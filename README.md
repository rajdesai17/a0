2. **Add Documentation URLs** (optional): Include API docs for integration
3. **Get Your Component**: Receive code, preview, and instructions instantly

## 💡 Example Usage

```
"create a pricing card with Stripe integration"
"build a user dashboard with authentication"
"design a checkout flow with payment processing"
"create a data table with Supabase integration"
```

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm (recommended)
- Google AI Studio API key

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/rajdesai17/v0-split-screen-chaty.git
